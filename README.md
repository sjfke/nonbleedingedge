nonBleeedingEdge website

This is as a collection of notes and cheatsheets compiled over a number of years.
Initially ASCII text files, that were copied each time as needed.

To learn Sphinx and ReadTheDocs template, the long process of converting them to reStructured text started.

Much work remains, and this and the corresponding [web-site](https://nonbleedingedge.com/) are updated when 
time permits.

Comments, feedback and pull-requests are always welcomed.
