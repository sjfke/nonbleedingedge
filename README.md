nonBleeedingEdge website

This is as a collection of notes and cheatsheets compiled over a number of years.
Initially ASCII text files, that were copied from laptop to laptop each time as needed.

To learn Sphinx and ReadTheDocs template, and to create my own web-site the long process of converting them 
to reStructured text started.

Much work remains, and this and the corresponding [nonbleedingedge.com](https://nonbleedingedge.com/) web-site are 
updated when time permits.

Comments, feedback and pull-requests are always welcomed.
