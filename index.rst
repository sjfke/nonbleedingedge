This site is an online collection of my cheatsheets and howtos.

I admit the name **NonBleedingEdge** is kind of strange, but resulted from a discussion with
another **aging techie** who also found himself forced into semi-retirement...

:Question: How can an ***aging techie*** be of any use in the ever changing I.T. industry?

:Afterall: Your brain stops functioning at 50... right? |:roll_eyes:|

:Answer: *"Experience"* which should never be under-valued. |:bulb:|

This site is written by an **aging techie** so obviously is **Non-Bleeding-Edge**! |:laughing:|

    * It attempts to condense various work experience into quick reference guides.
    * The style is deliberately terse, like an engineering logbook.
    * Suggestions, comments, corrections or contributions are always welcomed.
