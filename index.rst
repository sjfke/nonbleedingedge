Welcome to NonBleedingEdge!
===========================

This site is an online collection of my cheatsheets and howtos.

I admit the name *"NonBleedingEdge"* is kind of strange, but resulted from a discussion with another 
*"aging techie"* who also found himself forced into semi-retirement... 

:Question: How can an *"aging techie"* be of any use in the ever changing I.T. industry? 

:Afterall: Your brain stops functioning at 50... right? 

:Answer: *"Experience"* which should never be under-valued.

So this site is not *"Bleeding Edge"* (urgh) but attempts to condense some of my work experience into 
quick reference guides. The style is deliberately terse, for us *"seniors"* it's more like an 
engineering logbook.

Suggestions, comments, corrections or contributions are always welcomed. 

Hope you find it useful, and keep coming back because the site will be updated frequently.
