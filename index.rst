   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to NonBleedingEdge!
===========================

This site is an online collection of my programming and application notes, cheatsheets and howtos.

I admit the name *NonBleedingEdge* is kind of strange, but resulted from a discussion with another 
aging *techie* who also found himself forced into semi-retirement... afterall your brain stops 
functioning at 50, so how can you be of any use in the ever changing I.T. industry? 

:Answer: *experience* which should never be under-valued.

So this site is not *Bleeding Edge* (urgh) but attempts to condense some of my work experience into 
quick reference guides. The style is deliberately terse, for us *seniors* it's more like an 
engineering logbook.

Hope you find it useful.

Suggestions, comments, corrections or contributions are always welcomed.
