*****************
Homebrew Updating
*****************

* ``brew update`` updates `Homebrew` itself
* ``brew upgrade`` updates the installed packages.

Typical workflow

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew doctor  [--verbose]  # ensure brew is clean and consistent
    $ brew update  [--verbose]  # update the formulae and Homebrew itself
    $ brew outdated             # what is outdated
    $ brew upgrade [--verbose]  # upgrade everything
    $ brew upgrade <formula>    # upgrade a specific formula
    $ brew doctor  [--verbose]  # ensure brew is still clean and consistent

**************
Homebrew Casks
**************

The ``--cask`` extension is built on top of `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ to simplify the
installation and updating of applications such as `Google Chrome <https://www.google.com/chrome/>`_,
`Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>`_, `Alfred <https://www.alfredapp.com/>`_,
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ etc. (avoids manually downloading and installing the ``.dmg`` file)

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew search --cask firefox                 # search, incomplete names permitted
    $ brew install --cask [--verbose] firefox    # install
    $ brew uninstall --cask [--verbose] firefox  # uninstall
